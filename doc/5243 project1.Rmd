# **What make Ed-Sheeran Sucess?**
# **Is there any specific elements makes him so success in pop music?**
![eds](https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/ed-sheeran-smile-2017-u-billboard-u-1548.jpg)  

Ed-sheeran is my favourite pop music artist.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Ed-Sheeran is an English singer, songwriter, guitarist, record producer, and actor. He attended the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford as an undergraduate from the age of 18 in 2009. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project. After signing with Asylum Records, his debut album, + (pronounced "plus"), was released in September 2011. It topped the UK and Australian charts, reached number five in the US, and has since been certified seven-times platinum in the UK. The album contains the single "The A Team", which earned him the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. "The A Team" was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2013 Grammy Awards, where he performed the song with [q=Elton John].  (From artist.csv dataset)  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Today music industry is heavily related on the data,and there is a necessity for artists who want to be profitable to utilize data science to analyze the trend in the industry.Hence, in thie project,I will use text mining and exploratory analysis to figure out is there any specific style (such as lyrics'length, emotion, and topic) that makes his songs so sucuessful in pop music? By doing this, I am going to compare the lyrics of other pop music artists with Ed-Sheeran to see what is the different between them, so we can pay more attention to them or ED-Sheeran's songs are just typical pop music there is no any specifical different.  

In  this project I will compare the different between Ed-Sheeran's songs with other artists in pop music by conducting a text-mining with sentiment analysis, word cloud, topics modelling, and exploratory to answer the following questions:  

## **(1)Is the lyric's length in each song a specifical feature make the song success? (In other words, let Ed-Sheeran's songs standing out)**  

## **(2）Is the emotion in lyrics an important feature to make Ed-Sheeran success?**  

## **(3)Are the word use and context topic important features to make Ed-Sheeran success?**

#### About the Data Sets  


+ "processed lyrics data" is a filtered corpus of 380,000+ song lyrics from from MetroLyrics, and it already proprocessed & Cleaned by the ADS group.  

 + "artists.csv" provides the background information of all the artistis.  

### Step one. Set up & Load Data  
                                    
```{r load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

#  installed packages


# load packages
library("rvest")
library("tibble")
library("syuzhet")
library("sentimentr")
library("gplots")

library("tm")
library("topicmodels")
library("stringr")
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(RCurl)

library(wordcloud2)
```
#### Load the Dataset and get a sense of data  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#load the datasets
artist<-read.csv('../data/artists.csv')
#artist
load('../output/processed_lyrics.RData') 
head(dt_lyrics)

```
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#Since this project, our goal is to find diffrence between other artists and ED-Sheeran in pop music, we will focuesed in the pop music genre and seperate our data set by Ed-Sheeran and others.
dt_popmusic<-dt_lyrics[dt_lyrics$genre=='Pop',]
dt_popmusic$edsherran1<-ifelse(dt_popmusic$artist=='ed-sheeran',1,0)
edsherran=dt_lyrics[dt_lyrics$artist=='ed-sheeran',]
pop_noedsherran=dt_popmusic[dt_popmusic$artist!='ed_sherran',]
dt_popmusic$nwords <- nchar(dt_popmusic$stemmedwords)

lyrics <- dt_lyrics[dt_lyrics$artist == "ed-sheeran",]
```
### Explanatory Analysis  

#### Distribution of genre graph  

We first draw the distribution in genere, to get a first sense of our data.We can see the pop music is the second largest song genre, so it's worth studying.  


```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}

length_df_year<-dt_lyrics %>% group_by(genre) %>% 
summarise(n=n())

length_df_year %>% 
arrange(desc(genre)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x= reorder(genre, -n), y=n)) +
geom_bar(stat='identity', fill="#1CCCC6") + 
ylab("number of song") + xlab ("") + 
ggtitle("distribution of genre") + 
theme_minimal()

```
###Analysis of Lyrics'word count  

### *(1)Is the lyric's length in each song a specifical feature make the song success? (In other words, let Ed-Sheeran's songs standing out)  

#### Average number of words use in each genre  

We can see,Hip-hop has the highest avg number of words used because Hip-Hop focues on rhythm of lyrics.  
Jazz has the lowest avg number of words used in songs because Jazz focues on melody.  
Pop has middle avg number of words, and is around 400.  


```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt_lyrics$nwords <- nchar(dt_lyrics$stemmedwords)
dt_lyrics %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(nwords),freq=n(),avg=n/freq) %>%
  filter(genre!="Not Available") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(genre,-avg),y=avg), stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Avg Number of words used") +
  xlab("Genre") +
  ylab("Word Counts") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color="red", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 15))
```
#### Average word use in songs Ed-Sheeran vs Other Artists  


We draw a directly graph to see the difference in length of words used between Ed-Sheeran and other artist,0 represent other artists and 1 represent ED-Sheeran. We realized Ed-Sheeran has more words used in average.This indicates Ed-Sheeran usually write more words in lyrics than others artists in pop music in average, and can be a reason for Ed-Sheeran's success because his songs always tell people a story.  


```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
dt_popmusic %>%
  group_by(edsherran1) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(nwords),freq=n(),avg=n/freq) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(edsherran1,-avg),y=avg), stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Number of words used") +
  xlab("artist") +
  ylab("Word Counts") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color="red", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 15))
```
#### Distribution of word counts of Ed-Sheeran's songs   

A more detail distribution of word count of Ed-Sheeran, and the average is around 350.   


```{r,echo=FALSE}
edsherran $length <- str_count(edsherran $lyrics,"\\S+")
length_df <- edsherran %>%
             group_by(song) %>% 
             summarise(length = sum(length))
ggplot(length_df, aes(x=length)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=30,aes(fill = ..count..)) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(length)),
             color="#FFFFFF", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_density(aes(y=25 * ..count..),alpha=.2, fill="#1CCCC6") +
  ylab("Count") + xlab ("Legth") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of word count") + 
  theme_minimal()
```
#### Distribution of word counts of other artists  

We can see the distribution have significant left skew, and the average word counts is 249 which less than Ed-Sheeran in avg.   

```{r,warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
pop_noedsherran$length <- str_count(pop_noedsherran$lyrics,"\\S+")
length_dfnoed <- pop_noedsherran %>% filter(year>2010)%>%
             group_by(song) %>% 
             summarise(length = sum(length))
ggplot(length_dfnoed, aes(x=length)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=30,aes(fill = ..count..)) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(length)),
             color="#FFFFFF", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_density(aes(y=25 * ..count..),alpha=.2, fill="#1CCCC6") +
  ylab("Count") + xlab ("Legth") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of word count") + xlim(1,1000)+
  theme_minimal()


```
Base on the graphs above, we can conclude that the length of words make difference between Ed-Sheeran and other pop music artist.  

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(textdata)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```


## Sentiment analysis and word cloud   

### **(2）Is the emotion in lyrics an important feature to make Ed-Sheeran success?**   

#### Next, we want to analyze the difference between the lyric's compose.  

##### The word cloud for other pop artists   


From the graph we can see the word like love, baby ,time, heart demonstrate the lyrics. I guess the sentiment analysis should be joyful.   


```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
lyricsclean<-pop_noedsherran$stemmedwords
#creating a text corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(lyricsclean))
# Converting the text to lower case
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Removing english common stopwords
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
# creating term document matrix
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(tdm)
# getting word counts in decreasing order
word_freqs = sort(rowSums(m), decreasing=TRUE)
# creating a data frame with words and their frequencies
lyrics_wc_df <- data.frame(word=names(word_freqs), freq=word_freqs)
lyrics_wc_df <- lyrics_wc_df[1:100,]

# plotting wordcloud
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud2(data=lyrics_wc_df, size=1.6, color='random-dark')
```
##### Top 20 words use by other pop artist  

The bar graph give us more strict forward way to see the most frequency use words in pop music.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=lyrics_wc_df[1:20,],aes(x=reorder(word,freq),y=freq))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=word),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("word")+ylab("counts")+
ggtitle("Top 20 words use by other pop artist ")+
theme_minimal()+coord_flip()
```
#### Word cloud of Ed Sheeran  

The word cloud of Ed Sheeran and other artists are about the same, but the ill become larger in Ed sheeran's word cloud. Therefore, I guessing his songs are more depressed than others.   

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
lyricsclean1<-edsherran$stemmedwords
#creating a text corpus
docs1 <- Corpus(VectorSource(lyricsclean1))
# Converting the text to lower case
docs1 <- tm_map(docs1, content_transformer(tolower))
# Removing english common stopwords
docs1 <- tm_map(docs1, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
# creating term document matrix
tdm1 <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs1)
m1 <- as.matrix(tdm1)
# getting word counts in decreasing order
word_freqs1 = sort(rowSums(m1), decreasing=TRUE)
# creating a data frame with words and their frequencies
lyrics_wc_df1 <- data.frame(word=names(word_freqs1), freq=word_freqs1)
lyrics_wc_df1 <- lyrics_wc_df1[1:100,]
# plotting wordcloud
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud2(data=lyrics_wc_df1, size=1.6, color='random-dark')
```
#### Top 20 words use by Ed Sheeran   

Most of word use are pretty similar between Ed Sherran and other artists,but ill become the second frequency word used here. I assume the genre of pop music is joyful but Ed-Sherran's songs are depressed than mainstream artists.   

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=lyrics_wc_df1[1:20,],aes(x=reorder(word,freq),y=freq))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=word),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("word")+ylab("counts")+
ggtitle("Top 20 words use by ed sherran ")+
theme_minimal()+coord_flip()
```


**(2）Is the emotion in lyrics an important feature to make Ed-Sheeran success?**   


I find out the overall sentiment based on scores via `nrc` method of `syuzhet` package.The method classify each words in to 10 categories like anger,anticipation,disgust,feat,joy,sadness,surprise,trust,positive,and negative. We will seperate positive and neegative from other sentiment.  
### Total sentiment based on scores of Ed-Sheeran  

We can see trust has the highest sentiment scores and follow by sadness,joy,and fear.In particular sadness and fear is negative sentiment. It's consistent with my assume that Ed-Sheeran song is melancholy.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ty_sentiment <- get_nrc_sentiment((edsherran$stemmedwords))
# Dataframe with cumulative value of the sentiments
sentimentscores<-data.frame(colSums(ty_sentiment[,]))
# Dataframe with sentiment and score as columns
names(sentimentscores) <- "Score"
sentimentscores <- cbind("sentiment"=rownames(sentimentscores),sentimentscores)
rownames(sentimentscores) <- NULL
# Plot for the cumulative sentiments
ggplot(data=sentimentscores[1:8,],aes(x=reorder(sentiment,Score),y=Score))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=sentiment),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("Sentiments")+ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Total sentiment based on scores of Ed-Sheeran")+
theme_minimal() 
```
### Positive and negative based on scores Ed Sheeran   

In this graph we plot the positive and negative sentiment scores alone. As you can see, the negaive score is higher than the positive scores.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=sentimentscores[9:10,],aes(x=sentiment,y=Score))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=sentiment),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("Sentiments")+ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Positive and negative based on scores Ed Sheeran")+
theme_minimal() 
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ty_sentiment <- get_nrc_sentiment((pop_noedsherran$stemmedwords))
# Dataframe with cumulative value of the sentiments
sentimentscores<-data.frame(colSums(ty_sentiment[,]))
# Dataframe with sentiment and score as columns
names(sentimentscores) <- "Score"
sentimentscores <- cbind("sentiment"=rownames(sentimentscores),sentimentscores)
rownames(sentimentscores) <- NULL
```
### Total sentiment based on scores Othe Artist  

We can see joy has higest scores follow by trust, anticipation, and sadness. It is clearly that the sentiment of other artists is more positive than Ed-Sheeran.   


```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Plot for the cumulative sentiments
ggplot(data=sentimentscores[1:8,],aes(x=reorder(sentiment,Score),y=Score))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=sentiment),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("Sentiments")+ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Total sentiment based on scores")+
theme_minimal() 
```
### Positive and negative based on scores other artists  

It's consistent with my assumption that other artists's sentiment in lyrics is more positive than Ed-Sheeran's.From previous graphs, we can confirm that Ed-Sheeran's songs have more negative emotion compare to other artists.   


```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=sentimentscores[9:10,],aes(x=sentiment,y=Score))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=sentiment),stat = "identity")+
theme(legend.position="none")+
xlab("Sentiments")+ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Total sentiment based on scores other artist")+
theme_minimal() 
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
#to see the top score word of each sentiment.
dt_popmusic$stemmedwords<- as.character(dt_popmusic$stemmedwords)
tidy_lyrics <-dt_popmusic %>% 
unnest_tokens(word,stemmedwords)
song_wrd_count <- tidy_lyrics %>% count(song)
lyric_counts <- tidy_lyrics %>%
left_join(song_wrd_count, by = "song") %>% 
rename(total_words=n)

```
### Top words used to express emotions and sentiments  

We find the top 10 words to express in each emotions. We can see that ill is a word with strong emotion associated with fear, disgust,sadness,anger,and negative. The ill is second highest word count of Ed-Sheeran's lyrics, and afffect the emotion a lot.  

```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
lyric_sentiment <- lyric_counts %>% 
inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"),by="word")
lyric_sentiment %>% 
count(word,sentiment,sort=TRUE) %>% 
group_by(sentiment)%>%top_n(n=10) %>% 
ungroup() %>%
ggplot(aes(x=reorder(word,n),y=n,fill=sentiment)) +
geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
facet_wrap(~sentiment,scales="free") +
xlab("Sentiments") + ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Top words used to express emotions and sentiments") +
coord_flip()
```
### Top songs in each emotions by Ed-Sherran.  

Now, I shift my focus to Ed-Sherran.I draw the plot to see the which songs has most strong associated emotions and want to analyze its lyrics. My favourite songs are I see fire, and photograph, so I want to further analyze these two songs.  

```{r, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
edsherran$stemmedwords<- as.character(edsherran$stemmedwords)
tidy_lyrics <-edsherran %>% 
unnest_tokens(word,stemmedwords)
song_wrd_count <- tidy_lyrics %>% count(song)
lyric_counts <- tidy_lyrics %>%
left_join(song_wrd_count, by = "song") %>% 
rename(total_words=n)
lyric_sentiment <- lyric_counts %>% 
inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"),by="word")
lyric_sentiment %>% group_by(sentiment)%>%
count(song,sentiment,sort=TRUE) %>% 
top_n(n=5) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=reorder(song,n),y=n,fill=sentiment)) + 
geom_bar(stat="identity",show.legend = FALSE) + 
facet_wrap(~sentiment,scales="free") + 
xlab("Songs") + ylab("Scores")+
ggtitle("Top songs in each emotions") +
theme (
axis.text.x  = element_text(size=6), 
axis.text.y  = element_text(size=6)
) +
coord_flip()
```
### Emotion of I see fire by Ed Sheeran.   

The main sentiment constitution of I see fire are fear,Sadness and anticipation.It has strong sentiment of fear, and now let we see the lyric.  


```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(fmsb)
iseefire=lyric_sentiment %>% group_by(sentiment)%>%
count(song,sentiment)%>%filter(song=='i-see-fire') %>%pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment,values_from = n)%>%select(-song,-negative,-positive)

iseefire<-rbind(rep(40,7),rep(0,7),iseefire)
radarchart(iseefire,pcol = 'blue',plwd=3)
iseefire
```
```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
edsherran[edsherran$song=='i-see-fire',]$lyrics
```
The sentences like:  
"if we should die tonight\nWe should all die together"  
"\nAnd I hope that you'll remember me\nAnd if the night is burning\nI will cover my eyes\nFor if the dark returns then\nMy brothers will die\"
It's clearly a sad song with fear.   

### Sentiment of photograph by Ed Sheeran  

Now, we see next song,photograph. The main sentiment of photograph is joyful and sadness. When I see the sentence like "Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes", which loving is joyful words but hurt is a sadness,negative word.  

```{r,warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
photograph=lyric_sentiment %>% group_by(sentiment)%>%
count(song,sentiment)%>%filter(song=='photograph') %>%pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment,values_from = n)%>%select(-song,-negative,-positive)

photograph<-rbind(rep(15,7),rep(0,7),photograph)
radarchart(photograph,pcol = 'blue',plwd=3)
edsherran[edsherran$song=='photograph',]$lyrics
```
## Now,we want to test whether the emotion changed overr the year?   
### Emotion words of pop genre in percent by year other artist   
From the graph, we can see joy govern the pop music genre all the time and we can see the word cloud of pop music contian a lots positive words like "love","baby".  


```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(dt_popmusic$stemmedwords))
word_tibble <- tidy(corpus) %>%
  select(text) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  left_join(dt_lyrics, by='id') %>%
  select(id, text, year, genre) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
word_tibble %>%
  left_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by = "word") %>%

  group_by(year, sentiment) %>%
  summarize(freq = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent=round(freq/sum(freq)*100)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=percent, color=sentiment, group=sentiment)) +

    axis.title.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 15))

```
### Emotion words of pop genre in percent by year Ed Sheeran   


THere is not  a sentiment stay for the top for a long period.  

```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(edsherran$stemmedwords))
word_tibble <- tidy(corpus) %>%
  select(text) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  left_join(dt_lyrics, by='id') %>%
  select(id, text, year, genre) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
word_tibble %>%
  left_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by = "word") %>%
  filter(!(sentiment == "negative" | sentiment == "positive" | sentiment == "NA"|year <= 1960 )) %>%
  group_by(year, sentiment) %>%
  summarize(freq = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent=round(freq/sum(freq)*100)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=percent, color=sentiment, group=sentiment)) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  geom_point(size=.5) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Emotion word counts (%)") +
  ggtitle("Emotion words of ED Sheeran in percent by year") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color="red", size=14, face="bold.italic"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=14, face="bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 15))

```
#### conclusion:   

Base on the above analysis. we can conclude that pop musci genere is joyful and positive, but Ed Sheeran's music contain much more sadness, fear,and negative emotion than other artists. This is a interesting point to seperate Ed-Sheeran from other pop music artist.  

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
docs1<-tm_map(docs1,stemDocument)
dtm1 <- DocumentTermMatrix(docs1)
rowTotals <- apply(dtm1 , 1, sum) #Find the sum of words in each Document
dtm1  <- dtm1[rowTotals> 0, ]
corpus.list=edsherran[rowTotals>0, ]
```
## **(3)Are the word use and context topic important features to make Ed-Sheeran success?**  
### From the word cloud in previous section, we can see there is not significant difference in the most frequency word use between Ed-Sheeran and other artist. However, Ed-SHeeran always use the word like ill which express negative emotion.  
#### In this part, I am going to use LDA topic modelling to see what are some topics of Ed-Sheeran's song?  
We classify Ed-Sheeran's lyrics in to 8 topics:  
```{r, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#Set parameters for Gibbs sampling
burnin <- 4000
iter <- 2000
thin <- 500
seed <-list(2003,5,63,100001,765)
nstart <- 5
best <- TRUE
#Number of topics
k <- 8
#Run LDA using Gibbs sampling
ldaOut <-LDA(dtm1, k, method="Gibbs", control=list(nstart=nstart, 
                                                 seed = seed, best=best,
                                                 burnin = burnin, iter = iter, 
                                                 thin=thin))
#write out results

ldaOut.topics <- as.matrix(topics(ldaOut))

}
topics.terms
```

```
Base on the result, we can summary the hastag for these topic:

# **Conclusion:**  
Base on my analysis, we can see Ed-Sheeran has more word in the songs than other artist because Ed-Sheeran's songs like Photography  and Supermarket follower tell stories to people.  
In word use, Ed-SHeeran use similar word than other pop artists, such as "love", "baby","your",but Ed-Sheeran tend to use more negative words like sad and illness in his lyrics.
In sentiment analysis, we can see most of pop music are joyful, and positive. However, Ed-Sheeran's songs have more negative and sadness emotion because he always use the word like ill and sad, which has the high score in negative sentiments.  
Lastly, I analyze the 8 major topics of Ed-Sheeran's lyrics.If other artists want to make more profit and more success, they may pay take care about these categories.  
In the future, we can combine melody（acoustic elements) and lyrics together to see the specific patterns of Ed-Sheeran‘s song.
